Macaques are medium-sized primates with a sturdy body and strong limbs. Their thick fur is mostly gray-brown in color, but can also be almost black. The faces are hairless and have a protruding snout, strong predator-like teeth, a strong jaw and a protruding nose with English and short nostrils. Some species have striking "caps" on their heads or beard-like facial hair. An important distinguishing feature is the length of the tail: the Barbary Macaque is tailless, some species (for example the Japanese macaque or the bear macaque) have only a stub tail, for other species (for example the Great Macaque or Rhesus monkey) the tail is as long as the body. Macaques reach a head hull length of 40 to 76 centimeters and a weight of 2.5 to 18 kg, whereby males are often half as heavy as females. The Ceylon hat monkey is the smallest, the Tibetan macaque the largest (Quoated for Wikipedia).</p>
